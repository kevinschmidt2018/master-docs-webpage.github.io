<h2>Chicago Residents Voice Needs of Safety, Improved Access to Lake Shore Drive at Open House</h2>

<p>by Kevin Schmidt</p>

<p>Chicago residents expressed their views and concerns on how North Lake Shore Drive can better accommodate pedestrians during a public meeting at the DePaul University Student Center on Wednesday. Hosted by the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Chicago Department of Transportation, the meeting was held as on open forum that allowed attendees to study alternatives for the stretch of U.S. 41 from Grand Avenue to Hollywood Avenue and discuss the proposals with project team members. The third in an ongoing series, the open house also allowed project team members to counter previously expressed concerns.</p>  

<p>“We’ve heard lots of comments about crashes on the Lakefront Trail,” said Kimberly Murphy, project manager with the Illinois Department of Transportation. “One way we’re addressing that is separating the higher speed bicycling and pedestrian from the lower speed, the commuter bicycles from the people with strollers.”</p>  

<p>Besides pedestrian safety along lakefront paths and trails, obtaining feedback on initiatives like improved access points was one of the goals Murphy had in meeting with residents.</p> 

<p>Edgewater resident Susan McClain was critical of the current state of some viaducts near her neighborhood. “Wilson and Lawrence are both really decrepit,” she said. “A bridge is safer, and it’s a better view. If it’s late at night, you would never go under a bridge unless someone was around.”</p> 

<p>Safety in and around underpasses was brought to light when 25-year-old Raven Lemons was shot to death last month in Streeterville while standing near the pedestrian tunnel to Ohio Street Beach. The incident prompted city officials to close the underpass nightly from midnight to 5 a.m. until October.</p>

<p>“The viaducts and underpasses aren’t safe,” said Jenna Brose, a 29-year-old resident of River North. “They’re dark. As I woman, I wouldn’t feel safe there.”</p>

<p>David Kostelansky, who lives near the underpass at Chicago Avenue, expressed his issues with the access point. “We get a steady stream of people until late at night coming down Chicago Avenue and going underneath,” said the 66-year-old resident, who’s also president of the Lake Shore Park Advisory Council. “I’ve stood there with an off-duty armed policeman in the park watching drug transactions going on.”</p> 

<p>The open house featured an audio-visual presentation and imaged renderings to “get people to start reimaging how the access would be, because they’re not so great,” said Murphy. “Some places don’t have ramps, you’ve small stairs, there’s dripping water, and they’re not inviting. We’re looking to change that by making it easy to find, something that’s inviting, something that connects the lakefront to the west side of Lake Shore Drive.”</p>

<p>“The idea in some of these drawings of having on overpass which could be lit is so much smarter because it could be visible and you don’t have to worry about the people hiding in there at night,” said Kostelansky. “I like the idea, and the community likes the idea.”</p>
